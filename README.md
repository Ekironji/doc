## Getting Super Powers

**Edgehog** makes it easy to deploy code to fleets of connected devices, bringing the power of Linux containers to the edge. We've optimized the cloud paradigm for remote devices, taking familiar container workflows and custom building for low overhead, high reliability, and out-of-the-box support across a wide variety of devices. With a few simple commands, you can monitor, manage, and update your fleet from anywhere.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

I would to write code

```text
$ sudo adduser $USER dialout
```
